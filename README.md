<p id="description">Custom Multiplayer Chess Game Developed a full-stack real-time chess application featuring interactive gameplay and efficient WebSocket communication. Backend Development: Designed and implemented the server using Node.js with Express and Socket.io for WebSocket communication. Utilized the Chess.js library to manage game state enforce rules and validate player moves. Configured the application to dynamically assign roles (white/black/spectator) based on game state and connection events. Implemented robust event handling for moves ensuring game state synchronization and smooth gameplay. Deployed EJS templating for dynamic HTML rendering and served static assets efficiently. Frontend Development: Built a responsive chessboard UI with HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API for intuitive piece movements. Leveraged Socket.io to handle real-time updates for player roles board state and opponent moves. Used the Chess.js library for client-side validation and board rendering. Implemented distinct views for players and spectators dynamically flipping the board for black players. Rendered chess pieces with Unicode symbols to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Key Achievements: Designed seamless player interactions with real-time move validation and game state broadcasting. Delivered a scalable and interactive experience accommodating players and spectators simultaneously. Enhanced code modularity by encapsulating game logic and UI rendering.</p>
